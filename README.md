# Asteroids-Projects
# This project, a GUI application, was completed in my CS1110, Introduction to Python class during fall semester at Cornell University. It is a version of the game, Asteroids. For this project, I used fundamentally everything I learned in the class, primarily GUI code. I used tools such as recursion, for/while loops, classes and all of the things that come along with classes, such as methods, getters and setters.
