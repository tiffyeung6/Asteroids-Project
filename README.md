#Images-Project (A6 files)
# This project, a complex GUI application, was completed in my CS110, Introduction to Python class during my fall semester (2022) at Cornell University. It is an assignment where I practiced applying classes from its Interface, learned manipulating images by pixels, and how to write code for unicode strings that included emojis. I practiced skills such as iteration through 1D and 2D lists, enforcing class invariants, and writing code for underspecified functions and methods.





# Asteroids-Project
# This project, a GUI application, was completed in my CS1110, Introduction to Python class during fall semester at Cornell University. It is a version of the game, Asteroids. For this project, I used fundamentally everything I learned in the class, primarily GUI code. I used tools such as recursion, for/while loops, classes and all of the things that come along with classes, such as methods, getters and setters.
